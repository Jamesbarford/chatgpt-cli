# Chat GPT - command line + c library

- Fast
- Supports loading files into chat
- SQLite3 for persistence between sessions - opt in, off by default
- System prompts
- Set model parameters
- Clear chat history / or a specific message

N.B - Requires an [openai key](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api)

## Who is this for?
If, like me, you spend a lot of time in the terminal perhaps use something like
tmux to flip between different programs you'll probably get some mileage from 
this tool. It's like the web chatgpt interface except from the command line
and with some additional benefits like deleting individual messages from history.
